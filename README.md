# Efficient_Image_Segmentation

This repository contains implementation of the paper: [Efficient Graph based image segmentation](https://cs.brown.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf)

### Completed Stuff
* Building the grid graph
* implementation of union find datastructure with the custom loss function
* Using the above two to segment the image

### Pending
* Implementation of K-d tree as explained in [K-d tree](http://www.keithschwarz.com/cs106l/spring2010/handouts/030_Assignment_2_KDTree.pdf)
* Buidling the nearest neighbor graph
* Using Union find on nearest neighbor graph to perform image segmentation
